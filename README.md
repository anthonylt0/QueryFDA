# QueryFDA

This is a project I worked on to support a prior working group. Given a manufacturer ID, this application querys data from AccessGUDID and determines if it is a trackable medical device.
This was used in order to save time by manually looking devices up and determining if it is something that is trackable. From having to search and determine if an item is in a list, will just give you the answer as to whether or not it is tracked.
I was able to save a lot of time determining if a three-letter code was on a list, and would be able to give answers to whether or not it is tracked in real-time

Built with HTML, CSS, and JS.
